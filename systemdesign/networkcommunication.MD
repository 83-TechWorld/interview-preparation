## Load Balancer

### What is a Load Balancer?

A Load Balancer acts as a traffic cop, distributing incoming network requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. This optimizes resource utilization and enhances the scalability and reliability of web applications.

### How it Works

Load balancers distribute traffic based on various algorithms:
- **Round-robin**: Distributing traffic evenly among servers
- **Least connections**: Sending requests to the server with fewest active connections
- **Server load**: Directing traffic to less busy servers
- **Server health**: Ensuring requests are sent to healthy servers only

### Benefits
- ✅ Improved performance through traffic distribution
- ✅ Increased availability with automatic failover
- ✅ Enhanced scalability by adding/removing servers
- ✅ Optimized resource utilization

### Types of Load Balancers

## Reverse Proxy

### What is a Reverse Proxy?

A Reverse Proxy serves as an intermediary between client devices and web servers. It receives requests from clients on behalf of the servers, acting as a gateway to handle tasks such as load balancing, SSL termination, and caching.

### How it Works

1. Client sends request to reverse proxy
2. Proxy fetches content from origin server
3. Proxy delivers content to client
4. Provides caching, security, and load balancing
