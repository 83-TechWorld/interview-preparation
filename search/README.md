## 📋 Overview

Understanding these data structures is crucial for:
- **Technical Interviews** at top tech companies (FAANG+)
- **System Design** discussions
- **Building scalable applications**
- **Optimizing database performance**
- **Implementing efficient search systems**

## 🗂️ Data Structures

### 1. B-Tree

#### What is it?
A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations in O(log n) time.

#### Key Characteristics
- Multiple keys per node (unlike binary trees)
- Self-balancing structure
- Optimized for disk I/O operations
- Height grows logarithmically with data

#### Where it's used
- **Database Systems**: MySQL InnoDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB
- **File Systems**: NTFS, HFS+, ext4
- **Key-Value Stores**: BerkeleyDB, LMDB

#### Real-world Example
```python
# Conceptual B-Tree usage in database indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
# This creates a B-Tree index for fast email lookups
```

#### When to use
- When you need to minimize disk I/O operations
- For range queries in databases
- When dealing with large datasets that don't fit in memory

---

### 2. Hash Table

#### What is it?
A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function, providing O(1) average-case time complexity for insert, delete, and search operations.

#### Key Characteristics
- Key-value pair storage
- Constant-time average operations
- May have collisions (handled via chaining or open addressing)
- Not suitable for ordered data

#### Where it's used
- **Programming Languages**: Python dictionaries, Java HashMap, C++ unordered_map
- **Caching Systems**: Redis, Memcached
- **Database Indexing**: Hash indexes in PostgreSQL
- **Symbol Tables**: Compiler design

#### Real-world Example
```python
# Python dictionary (hash table implementation)
user_cache = {
    "user_123": {"name": "John", "age": 30},
    "user_456": {"name": "Jane", "age": 25}
}
# O(1) lookup time
user = user_cache.get("user_123")
```

#### When to use
- When you need fast lookups by key
- For implementing caches
- When order of elements doesn't matter
- For removing duplicates from datasets

---

### 3. Trie (Prefix Tree)

#### What is it?
A tree-like data structure used for storing strings where each node represents a character, enabling efficient prefix-based operations.

#### Key Characteristics
- Each path from root to leaf represents a word
- Efficient prefix searching O(m) where m is string length
- Space-efficient for common prefixes
- Supports lexicographic ordering

#### Where it's used
- **Search Engines**: Google autocomplete, search suggestions
- **Spell Checkers**: Microsoft Word, Grammarly
- **IP Routing**: Longest prefix matching in routers
- **Word Games**: Scrabble, Wordle implementations

#### Real-world Example
```python
# Trie for autocomplete feature
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_word = False

# Used in search bars for suggestions
# Typing "app" suggests: ["apple", "application", "apply"]
```

#### When to use
- For autocomplete/typeahead features
- When you need to find words with common prefixes
- For spell checkers and word validation
- In IP routing tables

---

### 4. Bloom Filter

#### What is it?
A probabilistic data structure that tests whether an element is a member of a set, with possible false positives but no false negatives.

#### Key Characteristics
- Space-efficient (uses bit array)
- Probabilistic (may have false positives)
- Cannot delete elements (variants like Counting Bloom Filter can)
- Fixed size regardless of elements added

#### Where it's used
- **Web Browsers**: Chrome's malicious URL detection
- **Databases**: Cassandra, HBase for reducing disk lookups
- **Blockchain**: Bitcoin for transaction verification
- **CDNs**: Akamai for cache filtering

#### Real-world Example
```python
# Bloom filter for checking if username exists
bloom = BloomFilter(capacity=1000000, error_rate=0.001)
bloom.add("john_doe")
bloom.add("jane_smith")

# Fast check with possible false positive
if "new_user" in bloom:
    # Might be taken (or false positive)
    # Do expensive database check
    pass
```

#### When to use
- When you can tolerate false positives
- For reducing expensive disk/network lookups
- In distributed systems for membership testing
- For detecting previously seen items

---

### 5. Inverted Index

#### What is it?
A data structure that maps content (words) to their locations in documents, enabling fast full-text searches.

#### Key Characteristics
- Maps terms to document IDs
- Enables O(1) document retrieval for a term
- Supports boolean and ranked queries
- Can include position information

#### Where it's used
- **Search Engines**: Google, Elasticsearch, Solr
- **Document Databases**: MongoDB text search
- **Code Search**: GitHub code search
- **Email Systems**: Gmail search functionality

#### Real-world Example
```python
# Inverted index structure
inverted_index = {
    "python": [doc1, doc5, doc8],
    "java": [doc2, doc5, doc9],
    "database": [doc1, doc2, doc8]
}
# Search for "python AND database"
# Result: intersection of [doc1, doc5, doc8] and [doc1, doc2, doc8] = [doc1, doc8]
```

#### When to use
- For building search engines
- In document retrieval systems
- For log analysis and searching
- In e-commerce product search

---

### 6. Skip List

#### What is it?
A probabilistic data structure that allows O(log n) search, insertion, and deletion by maintaining multiple layers of linked lists.

#### Key Characteristics
- Multiple layers with "express lanes"
- Probabilistic balancing
- Simpler than balanced trees
- Cache-friendly structure

#### Where it's used
- **Databases**: Redis sorted sets, MemSQL
- **In-memory DBs**: LevelDB, RocksDB (as memtable)
- **Concurrent Systems**: ConcurrentSkipListMap in Java
- **Game Development**: Leaderboards, ranking systems

#### Real-world Example
```python
# Skip list for maintaining sorted leaderboard
class SkipList:
    # Levels: [1] -> [3] -> [7] -> [9] -> [12] -> [17]
    #         [1] --------> [7] --------> [12] -> [17]
    #         [1] ----------------------> [12] ------]
    
    # Fast O(log n) operations for ranked data
    def insert(self, score, player_id):
        pass
    
    def get_rank(self, player_id):
        pass
```

#### When to use
- When you need sorted data with concurrent access
- As an alternative to balanced trees

#### Real-world Example
```python
# LSM Tree write path
# 1. Write to in-memory buffer (memtable)
memtable.put(key, value)

# 2. When full, flush to disk as SSTable
if memtable.is_full():
    sstable = memtable.flush_to_disk()
    
# 3. Periodic compaction merges SSTables
compact_and_merge_sstables()
```

#### When to use
- For write-intensive applications
- In time-series databases
- For append-only workloads
- When writes far exceed reads

# Efficient for range queries:
# SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 35
# Scans sequential blocks on disk
```
