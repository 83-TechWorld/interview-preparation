Database design patterns provide reusable solutions for typical problems in structuring and accessing data, while anti-patterns highlight common mistakes to avoid. Choosing the right database technology—SQL or NoSQL—depends on the needs for scalability, consistency, and data structure. Here’s an overview to help you make informed decisions for AWS and Azure platforms.[1][2][3][4]

***

### Database Design Patterns

- **Single Table Inheritance**: All entities are stored in a single table, using a type column to differentiate records.[5]
- **Polymorphic Associations**: Implemented with a linked table and type field to allow flexible references, often used for comments or attachments.[5]
- **Computed Patterns**: Storing computed values for performance, but requiring careful update logic.[5]
- **Extended Reference**: Breaks up object data across multiple related tables, used for complex or optional fields.[5]
- **Sharding**: Data is split across multiple databases for horizontal scalability; ideal for very large datasets.[1]

***

### Anti-Design Patterns

- **Data Monolith**: Multiple services share a centralized database, leading to tight coupling and reduced scalability.[6]
- **Unbounded Arrays/Bloated Documents**: Document stores with unbounded nested fields can degrade performance and complicate queries.[5]
- **God Objects**: Overly complex and multi-purpose tables or documents make evolution and maintenance harder.[4]
- **Join In Conditions**: Placing filtering logic in JOIN conditions, which should be managed in WHERE clauses, can cause inefficient queries.[7]
- **Poor Indexing**: Failing to index critical fields leads to slow queries at scale.

***

### Managing Scalability & Reliability

- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing resources on a single server, typical for SQL databases until hardware limits are reached.[1]
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Distributing data across many machines; common in NoSQL systems for scalable web applications, real-time analytics, and microservices.[8]
- **Reliability**: SQL databases offer strong transactional consistency (ACID). NoSQL sacrifices some immediate consistency for high fault tolerance and distributed reliability (eventual consistency).[1]

### SQL vs. NoSQL: Key Differences

| Feature                | SQL (Relational)                         | NoSQL (Non-Relational)                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Data Structure         | Tables (rows/columns, fixed schema) [1] | Flexible: documents, key-value, graph, column | [1][8]
| Schema                 | Predefined, strict [1]                | Flexible or schemaless [1]                |
| Scalability            | Vertical [8]                         | Horizontal [8]                            |
| Transaction Consistency| Strong (ACID) [1]                    | Eventual consistency [1]                  |
| Query Language         | SQL [8]                              | Various (NoSQL-specific APIs, JSON queries) [8] |
| Use Cases              | Bank apps, ERP, structured data [8]  | Social networks, IoT, catalogs, analytics [8] |
| Example Platforms      | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server [8]    | MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra, Redis [8][3] |

### Example Databases in AWS & Azure

**Relational Databases**
- **AWS**: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, Oracle)[3][9]
- **Azure**: Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB[2][10]

**Non-Relational Databases**
- **AWS**: DynamoDB (key-value), DocumentDB (document), ElastiCache (Redis, Memcached, in-memory), Neptune (graph), Timestream (time-series), QLDB (ledger)[3]
- **Azure**: Cosmos DB (multi-model: document, graph, key-value), Table Storage (key-value), Redis Cache[10][2]

***

### When to Choose SQL or NoSQL

- **Choose SQL when**:
  - Data is structured and relationships are critical
  - Strong consistency and transactional integrity needed
  - Reporting, analytics, or legacy integration required
  - E.g., financial systems, inventory management[8][1]
- **Choose NoSQL when**:
  - Data is unstructured, semi-structured, or evolving
  - High volume, high velocity, or web-scale required
  - Real-time apps, personalization, streaming, IoT, catalogs, social feeds
  - E.g., mobile apps, product catalogs, session stores[8][3]

***

### Cloud Provider Decision Guidance

- **AWS**: Use RDS for traditional relational scenarios; DynamoDB for serverless, scalable, and flexible needs. ElastiCache for fast access and caching, Neptune for graph data.[9][3]
- **Azure**: Azure SQL Database for multi-region relational workloads; Cosmos DB for global scale with flexibility on model (document, graph, etc.); Redis for in-memory caching.[2][10]

Select based on scalability requirements (vertical/horizontal), consistency needs (strong/eventual), your application’s data structure, and integration ecosystem within AWS or Azure.[10][2][3][8]
